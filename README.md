How to use.
You can find the menu to interact with this mod in the Level Settings tool.
Simply check the levels you wish to keep visible and they'll stay visible you close the map or unselect the level.
The mod currently does not work when exporting. So neither its benefits, not its disadvantages will be available during export.

IMPORTANT!
The mod currently only works with up to 9 levels due to some constraints of Dungeondraft and the Goodot engine.
If you add a 10th level, it will overflow and show at the same hight as the 1st level, the 11th at the same height as the 2nd level and so on.
Additionally, each level only has 1000 layers, which can bleed over into the layers of the neighbouring levels.
E.g. the 'Floor' layer of any given level is at the same height as the 'Roofs' layer of the level below it.
